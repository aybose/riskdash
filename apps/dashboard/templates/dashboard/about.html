            <br>
            <br>
            Researchers produce brilliant ideas, and publishing a paper in a top journal is a significant achievement. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Quite often, the time series in the paper freeze at the time of publishing. For systemic risk analytics, if the goal is to understand where we stand today, reading charts from two years ago is not going to help much. We want real-time live time series. 
            <br>
            <br>
            If the paper is the proof of concept, producing real-time analytics based on the algorithms in the paper brings the concept to life. This is by no means a new idea. Measuring the implied volatility of S&P 500, the VIX index was first proposed in a paper by Brenner and Galai in 1989. In 1993, the Chicago Board Option Exchange (CBOE) started to compute VIX on a real-time basis. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This dashboard attempts to bring to life an entire set of systemic risk analytics, following the framework laid out in the <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1983602">survey</a> by Professor Andrew Lo from MIT, Dr. Mark Flood from the Office of Financial Research (OFR) and their co-authors.
            <br>
            <br>
            This is only the beginning. Our ultimate goals are:
            <br>
            <ol style="margin:1em">
            <li>Provide a platform that all researchers can publish live analytics on. Similar to Amazon.com serving a platform that other retailers can leverage, this site aspires to become the platform and portal for all researchers and consumers of systemic risk analytics.</li>
            <li>Provide a dashboard view of the state of systemic risks comprised of a handful of gauges, each indicating a key aspect of systemic risk such as liquidity and credit risk. Each real-time gauge will be powered by a single analytics or a combination of analytics chosen by domain experts.</li>
            </ol>
            Initiated by the Laboratory for Financial Engineering at MIT, this is a true collaboration of many, including the <a href="http://www.systemic-risk.org/">Consortium for Systemic Risk Analytics</a>, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT, as well as enterprise software product managers from the industry.
            <br>
            <br>
            Other universities and corporations also produce real time analytics. 
            <b>We welcome opportunities for collaboration.</b>
